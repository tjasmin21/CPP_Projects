Exceptions like "access violation" are not standard C++ exceptions, they
don't have a type and so the only way to catch them is to use catch (...).

In addition to enable catching of such exceptions (asynchronous exceptions)
in C++ you need to change the Enable C++ Exceptions compiler option from
/EHsc (the default) to /EHa (see Project Properties, Configuration
Properties, C/C++, Code Generation).
